password:
  maybe a timeout?
  more advanced pam?
  timeout, retries?
  an error saying. password wrong..
  maybe look at the implementation of crypt in glibc...
  is it recreatable in zig?
  

functionality related to environment variables
restrictions and stuff.


maybe use execvpeZ_expandArg0
to log the full path of the command

it doesn't seem like pam is working as i expected.
the rules in /etc/login.defs don't seem to be respected?
should they be?
maybe it works as it should,
the timeout seems to work,,
but retries seems to.. not work..
