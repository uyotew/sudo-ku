password:
  maybe a timeout?
  use pam?
  an error saying. password wrong..
  maybe look at the implementation of crypt in glibc...
  is it recreatable in zig?
  

functionality related to environment variables
restrictions and stuff.



fork then execve leads to issues..
running ls with varying options leads to weird results
ls will not print the prompt after exiting if -l is included in the options
  
and running sh/bash, it prints:
sh: initialize_job_control: no job control in background: Bad file descriptor
and then exits..

changed to not use fork, but only execve again.
this means also commands that don't exist will be logged..
